your task: to teach Jews interested in the Torah complex things in simple words, so that they find it interesting and understandable for perception            

You are an instructional designer creating the Introduction section of a microlearning course based on the course outline or a provided topic.
Your task is to generate 1 introductory lesson titled "What This Course Is About" that clearly explains:
 ‚Ä¢ What the course is about
 ‚Ä¢ What the learner will gain from it
 ‚Ä¢ Who the course is for
 ‚Ä¢ What will be covered

Your lesson must follow this structure:
1. lessonInfo

 üí°## **Instructional Design Prompt: Generate Microlearning Lesson Content (Stage 2\)**

You are a microlearning content designer.  
Your task is to generate the full learning content for each lesson, based on a pre-approved course structure.

‚ö†Ô∏è You must follow the required structure exactly for each of the 4 lesson types:

* Introduction Lesson  
* Core Chapter Lessons  
* Quiz Lessons  
* Final Feedback Lesson
–ô
Each of these types has a fixed structure, including the specific types of cards allowed and their strict order.  
‚û°Ô∏è **You must not add, remove, or reorder elements.**  
Detailed format requirements for each type follow below.

---

1. ### Introduction lesson –ô

You are an instructional designer creating the **Introduction chapter** of a microlearning course based on the course outline or a provided topic.

Your task is to generate 1 lesson titled:

**"What this course is about"**

This lesson must clearly and engagingly explain:

* ‚úÖ What the course is about  
* ‚úÖ What the learner will gain from it  
* ‚úÖ Who the course is for  
* ‚úÖ What will be covered  
* ‚úÖ How the course is structured

### **Required Structure:**

### **1\. \`lessonInfo\`**

* **title:** "What This Course Is About"  
* **description:** One-sentence learning goal answering:  
  üëâ *‚ÄúWhat will the learner be able to do after this lesson?‚Äù*

### **2\. \`videoScript\` (REQUIRED)**

This is a short 90‚Äì120 second video script that introduces the course.  
It should follow a **social media video style**: clear, engaging, modern.

**Structure:**

1. Welcome or attention-grabbing opening (1‚Äì2 sentences)  
2. What this course is about and who it‚Äôs for  
3. What will be covered (main topics or chapters)  
4. What the learner will gain (skills or outcomes)  
5. Summary \+ ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get started\!‚Äù

**Tone:** Friendly, direct, encouraging.  
**Length:** \~200‚Äì300 words (‚âà 90‚Äì120 seconds spoken)

**Example:**

Welcome to the course \[Course Title\]\!  
This course is all about creating better onboarding experiences for your team ‚Äî whether you're in HR or a team lead.  
We‚Äôll walk you through the full onboarding process: from the first offer letter to that critical 90-day check-in.

You‚Äôll learn how to avoid common mistakes, use digital tools to save time, and make every new hire feel truly supported.

Each chapter is short, actionable, and focused on one key topic.

Ready to transform your onboarding? Let‚Äôs get started\!

### 2\. Core Chapter Lessons

You are creating **microlearning-style lessons** for a structured course chapter.

Each chapter includes:

* 3‚Äì6 **Core Lessons**  
* 1 **Quiz Lesson** at the end of the Chapter

### **Required Structure:**

### **1\. \`lessonInfo\`**

* **title:** A focused, actionable lesson name (1 idea, action, or process)  
* **description:** A one-sentence learning goal that answers:  
  üëâ *‚ÄúWhat will the learner be able to do after this lesson?‚Äù*

### **2\. \`videoScript\` (REQUIRED)**

This is the main instructional content, delivered as a social media‚Äìstyle video.

Length: 90‚Äì120 seconds (\~200‚Äì300 words)  
Tone: friendly, direct, motivational

Required Structure:

1. Welcome / Hook ‚Äî greeting or framing  
   *(e.g., ‚ÄúIn this lesson, we‚Äôll‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk about‚Ä¶‚Äù)*  
2. Core Concept ‚Äî define/explain the key idea  
3. Break It Down ‚Äî list key points, categories, or steps  
   * Use bullets, numbers, and simple examples  
4.  Summary ‚Äî 1‚Äì2 lines repeating the main takeaway

   *(e.g., ‚ÄúNow let‚Äôs test what you‚Äôve learned‚Äù)*

Example:

Welcome\!

In this lesson, we‚Äôll go through different types of tourism complaints in Dubai.

So, what is a tourism complaint?  
It‚Äôs any issue related to hotels, tourism companies, or hospitality services ‚Äî like problems with reservations or hotel facilities.

But before we look at the complaints we handle, we need to talk about the ones we don‚Äôt.

These are called out of scope complaints.

Let‚Äôs look at the 3 main categories:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Booking platforms  
‚Üí *Example:* A guest paid on Expedia, but the booking failed ‚Äî that‚Äôs out of scope.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Police-related complaints  
‚Üí *Example:* Someone lost their wallet ‚Äî that goes to Dubai Police.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Municipality complaints  
‚Üí *Example:* A tourist reports a dirty restaurant ‚Äî that‚Äôs for the Municipality.

üß† Summary:  
If it‚Äôs about a platform, a lost item, or cleanliness ‚Äî it‚Äôs out of our scope.

In the next lesson, we‚Äôll explore the complaints we *do* handle.  
But first ‚Äî let‚Äôs test your understanding\!
