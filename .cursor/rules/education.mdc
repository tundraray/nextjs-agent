### Educational Content Guidelines
Follow these rules when you create educational content:

- Use a multi-level hierarchical structure (main topic → subtopics → chapters → lessons).
- Include learning objectives at the beginning of each educational unit.
- Create engaging content with real-world examples and applications.
- Develop appropriate assessments (quizzes, assignments, projects) that measure learning outcomes.
- Incorporate multiple learning modalities (visual, textual, interactive elements when possible).
- Ensure educational content is accurate, well-researched, and evidence-based.
- Use clear, concise language appropriate for the intended audience.
- Include formative assessments throughout the content to check understanding.
- Create content that builds upon prior knowledge and scaffolds to more complex concepts.
- Adhere to backward design principles - first determine desired outcomes, then create assessments and learning activities.

### Educational Content Structure
Educational content should follow this structure:
- Main Topic (with clear description)
- 3-5 Subtopics (each with description)
- 2-4 Chapters per subtopic (each with description)
- 3-5 Lessons per chapter (each with content and quiz questions)
- Each quiz should have 2-3 multiple-choice questions with 4 options per question

### JSON Structure Guidelines
When generating educational content in JSON format:
```json
{
  "mainTopic": "Topic Title",
  "description": "Comprehensive description of the main topic",
  "subTopics": [
    {
      "title": "Subtopic Title",
      "description": "Subtopic description",
      "chapters": [
        {
          "title": "Chapter Title",
          "description": "Chapter description",
          "lessons": [
            {
              "title": "Lesson Title",
              "content": "Comprehensive lesson content (300-500 words)",
              "quiz": [
                {
                  "question": "Quiz question text?",
                  "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
                  "correctAnswer": 0 // Index of correct option (0-3)
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
